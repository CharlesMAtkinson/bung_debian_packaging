Description: Database, file, router and switch backup to file system for one or many devices
 bung (BackUp Next Generation) was created in 2013 and is now known to be in
 regular use for backing up hundreds of laptops, PCs, phones, servers, routers
 and switches. It backs up files, MariaDB, OpenLDAP, postgres and -- via an
 extensible templates system with git support -- Cisco switches, MikroTik
 routers and Tejas optical line terminals.
 .
 Backups are written to local or remote file systems. Local file systems can be
 mounted when the backup starts and unmounted when it ends. This minimises the
 danger of accidentally removing backup files.
 .
 The rsync-based files backup creates a "rolling full" backup which is easy to
 browse and restore from using everyday tools. Changed and deleted files are
 retained for a configurable number of days, backups or file system usage %.
 When the source is on an LVM volume, snapshots can be used.
 .
 Backup jobs are scheduled or initiated by plugging in hotplug storage such as
 USB disks. When hotplug storage starts a backup, on-screen notifications
 (terminal or GUI) tell of the start and end of the backup.
 .
 When backing up to a remote file system, commands are run via ssh. For
 security, when run as root, bung on the remote server validates the commands
 before they are run.
 .
 Developed in a production environment, bung's log messages are designed to
 give the information needed to investigate problems.
 .
 Backup reports are optionally sent by email or by notification plug-ins.
 .
 bung is written in bash and uses the GPL-2.0+ license.
